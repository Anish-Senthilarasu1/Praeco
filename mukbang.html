                Candied Chipotle burritos smothered in cheese or Cane's sauce, whole seafood boils devoured in a matter of minutes, hair or bugs strategically placed to outrage audiences, and farm for commentary engagements–with the increasing use of social media, a new and unique trend has been dominating social platforms: mukbangs. It may seem silly, but this now not-so-little corner of the internet is not an isolated oddity. Its popularity has skyrocketed and often mirrors the trends we observe in modern society. Go for a scroll, and you may start to recognize how this short-form content plays on our gluttony, isolation, and vulnerability.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Though only recently popularized, mukbangs originated in South Korea in the late 2000s. The word "mukbang" is a combination of the Korean words meokneun ("eating") and bangsong ("broadcast").
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Mukbangs are successful because they provide a sense of social connection and companionship by essentially allowing viewers to "eat together" with the creator. Often accompanied by ASMR-like sounds that can be soothing, mukbangs provide entertainment through the spectacle of large quantities of food being consumed, which can be fascinating to watch even if viewers aren't actively hungry themselves. This company can be especially appealing to people who might feel isolated or lonely.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">How did mukbangs start?</h2>
            
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Mukbangs were first introduced in 2009 on AfreecaTV, a real-time internet TV service. South Korean creators then began popularizing the format in the early 2010s, through cable channels and terrestrial broadcasting.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Why are mukbangs popular?</h2>
            
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Mukbangs can help people feel less lonely when eating, providing a sense of community, especially during mealtimes. It is not uncommon for people on diets to watch Mukbangs when craving food and eat vicariously through Mukbang creators. This way, they can avoid actually eating the said food and still reach mental satisfaction.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">What does this popularity represent?</h2>
            
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                At its core, the sheer popularity of this type of media reveals to us an uncomfortable truth: We are becoming lonelier. This revelation is very telling of our embarrassing dependence on quick form, overstimulating media. According to statistics recorded by PBS, in the US, 60% of people report feeling lonely daily, rates higher than those who are affected by obesity or diabetes. These rates hold a stark increase from years prior, largely correlating with the pandemic. During this time, the popularity of mukbangs skyrocketed as they were introduced to new Western demographics which have since been sucked into the spectacle.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Mukbangs aren't only watched to satisfy lonely eaters, but also to satisfy off-putting cravings. In years past, mukbangs have grown from a cute form of media to bring people company in their meals, to rage baiting, and gross displays of food waste and gluttony. An often referenced contributor, Nickolas Perry, better known as Nikocado Avocado, pioneered this switch. Nickolas unsettlingly embraced his role as a lolcow, performing disturbing acts for the sake of interaction. But, the response to this type of content turned out to be arguably worse than its actual goal of outrageous engagement.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Such harmful response emerged from an effort to counter the previous social reformation period that advocated for higher standards of empathy and equality, allowing for the resurfacing of fatphobia as an acceptable philosophy. In contrast to countless body-positive movements that had tirelessly worked to dilute the stigmas around weight, this disturbing content gave people the perfect chance to turn to ridicule once again. Here was a media genre that actively invited and encouraged audiences to point, giggle, crack a few jokes, and dehumanize, making overweight people more of a spectacle than real beings.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This wide judgment didn't just confine itself to mukbang creators. It reverberated onto anyone deemed to be "too fat". Derogatory terms such as "big back" or "double wide", and even more than slightly contentious trends such as "girl dinner" thrived in this hateful internet landscape. In the mukbang community, these effects are actively seen in the glaring double standard between fit and fat creators. Scrolling in the comments of an overweight person's mukbang–even if the portions are healthy or reasonable–is a discouraging experience. Remarks on the creators' weight astoundingly overshadow any discussion of the video's actual content. On the other side, a skinny creator's comment section has close to no mentions of their "shameful diet," even if the portions are much more outrageous or unhealthy.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In the making of this new wave of anti-body positivity and loneliness, mukbangs have an odd yet undeniable role. To protect future generations from the destructive media crazes of perfect bodies, plastic surgery, and performative consumption, it is imperative that we, as potentially one of the last critically thinking, media-literate generations, take a much closer look at how these seemingly isolated online trends affect our social reality. Truly, how much more empathy can we surrender to luring, pointless outrage before there is none left to build something better?
