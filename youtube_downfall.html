                Baby shark, Gangnam style, cat memes. All these things are weirdly different, yet they all have one thing in common. These memes and videos were all a part of the rise of YouTube, and most importantly, are what made YouTube so distinct from other platforms. But now, it seems to not hold the distinctness from other social medias on the rise.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Founded on February 14th 2005, Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim, all ex PayPal employees, came together to create YouTube, not knowing it would be one of the biggest fads of the 21st century. Initially the app was meant to be a platform for users to share videos and profiles to find partners, but after that idea failed, the three founders put their heads together and pivoted to a broader video sharing platform after being inspired by the idea of something that hadn't been done before.

                Now why is this article titled the downfall of YouTube? There isn't one solid answer, and some may even argue YouTube isn't on the edge of a downward spiral. Well when it does come to the downfall aspect, there are many points to back it up.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Social media has become a rapid changing market, and we are also adapting with it. YouTube is known for its longer and wide variety of videos, and at first, this was what drew in viewers. Now, with TikTok and instagram reels, it provides short, more quickly engaging videos compared to YouTube. Our minds crave that dopamine hit, which is the feeling of satisfaction and motivation. While YouTube can do the same, other apps do this faster. Human attention spans have also declined due to this, and now YouTube tends to be a last resort for relaxing through social media.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                To change with the times, YouTube has created YouTube shorts, which are also shorter clips and reels to attract viewers. The problem is that TikTok - a popular social media app where people can share reels from 3 seconds to ten minutes - has been around longer than shorts, and ultimately has a better set of features. With shorts, videos have to be a max of 60 seconds, and doesn't offer as wide of editing options as TikTok. Still, shorts was a great idea and is still inviting to viewers, but doesn't compare to TikTok's algorithms.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                When it comes to being a creator on YouTube, there are many negative and positive aspects for people. Before, YouTube was <em>the</em> app where influencers and content creators started out. They were able to share insight into their lives and hobbies, which was unique in so many ways. Being able to make money from doing what they love was what made people not only want to consume the content but create as well. Now with instagram, TikTok, and other platforms, users are able to do the same, but in a way to quickly draw in viewers and fans.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                YouTube monetization mainly comes from advertisements, which initially seemed to be better to make money from than TikTok. Now, due to the rise of TikTok, creators are able to engage different audiences faster, and can prioritize the Creator Fund, basically a bank account coming directly from TikTok views. Although YouTube typically pays more, there are much more users on TikTok, which for many leads to more money compared to YouTube.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                So what are the YouTubers who used to thrive on YouTube doing? Of course, they've moved to TikTok. While creators still make content on YouTube, there has been a huge shift over to TikTok and posting on Snapchat and Instagram as well, because it leads to quicker revenue.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The decline of YouTube can be argued whether it is maintaining viewers or gaining, but overall, it seems to be falling. While YouTube provides good content, it is mainly the users who are the root cause of its downfall.
