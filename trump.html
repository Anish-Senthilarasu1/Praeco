                Before President Trump entered his second term of Presidency on January 20th, 2025, he promised that if elected to a second term, he would eliminate American communities. He plans to target immigrants who make valuable contributions to society and limit future immigrants from entering the country, even legally.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                President Trump has kept his promise to be more aggressive in his second term, deporting around 2000 people. Many of Trump's former senior officials had helped create the document Project 2025, which includes a detailed plan with over 175 immigration actions, such as enabling a Nationwide Deportation Machine and eliminating popular relief programs and Visa Categories. According to the ACLU - a non-profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to defending and preserving individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution-, Trump has "three areas of significant threats to immigrants and the U.S. communities and families they are a part of," These include mass deportations.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                A core promise of Trump's campaign is to "carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history." Trump plans on not only targeting illegal criminals but also families and children. He plans on attacking birthright citizenship, barring undocumented children from schools, and forcibly separating children from their parents at the border.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                While it may be true that presidents in the past have used deportation as a solution to illegal immigrants, President Trump's objective is fueled by xenophobia and racism, disregarding laws, basic human dignity, and justice.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The Obama Administration prioritized deporting individuals who posed a threat to national security, had serious criminal convictions, or were recent unlawful entrants. Trump's immigration enforcement policies expanded to consider all undocumented immigrants as priorities for removal, regardless of criminal history. Additionally, under Obama's presidency, policies emphasized prosecutorial discretion, considering factors like family ties and community contributions. Notably, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was introduced to protect certain young immigrants from deportation.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The Trump administration has diminished many policies that help ensure the safety of immigrants, such as the policy of restricting ICE arrests at sensitive locations such as hospitals, places of worship, and schools.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In addition to this, trying to acquire legal documentation has been "almost impossible", construction workers from Texas said, when asked by The Guardian. "The reason behind these policies comes from racism. The majority of immigrants aren't criminals. Like myself, a lot of immigrants come to this country to be able to fulfill their dreams, to be able to work. We're humans and we have rights. The things we go through when being held in immigration detention, unless you live them, you won't be able to understand it."
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Milton Vel√°squez, a construction worker from El Salvador, had temporary protected status (TPS), provisional protection given to nationals of some countries in crisis. Trump has already stripped 350,000 Venezuelans of these rights and has sparked concerns that he may also strip or restrict protections for one million immigrants from 17 countries that received them under the Biden administration.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                On top of these policies being revoked, many new incidents show ICE officers using aggressive tactics to root out undocumented immigrants, including those with no criminal record. A recent video, shared by NBC Boston, shows ICE agents smashing a car window to arrest a man, Juan Mendez, who was in the process of changing his immigration status. The agents called him "Antonio", mistaking him for another individual.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Additionally, President Trump has made it clear that anyone who participates in a pro-Palestine protest, especially students, is at risk of deportation. Protesting is an important part of freedom of speech- a constitutionally protected right - because it lets people speak out when they think something is unfair or wrong. It gives groups a way to be heard, especially if they feel ignored by the government or society.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Another instance of a wrongful deportation is the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old wrongfully deported to an El Salvador prison by the Trump Administration. Mr. Abrego Garcia was wrongfully deported, according to judges up to the US Supreme Court, and the US government ought to "facilitate" his return to his Maryland home. However, Mr. Abrego Garcia "will never live" in the United States again, according to the White House, which has accused him of belonging to the transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, a recognized foreign terrorist organization.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                When he was asked whether he'd return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, Bukele, President of El Salvador said, "How can I return him to the United States? Like, if I smuggle him into the United States? Of course, I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous." Trump then turned to Bukele and said, "They'd love to have a criminal released into our country. These are sick people."
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                From restricting policies to reopening family detention centers and wrongfully detaining individuals, Trump is actively harming immigrants and attacking their rights. Where do we draw the line between criminals convicted of dealing drugs, rape and murder vs criminals with speeding tickets? The truth is that the Trump Administration doesn't consider them different.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Many immigrants come to America with hopes of new lives for themselves, their parents, and their children. They go on dangerous and hard journeys to find the "American Dream". But when they do get here, they work through rigorous hours and provide tremendous support to our economy. All this, just to live in constant fear of being sent back to where they came from.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Now, with increasing threats of egregious media censorship and sparked mistrust between our long-standing allies, these terrible missteps made by the Trump administration have been disregarded by the majority of the US population. How much longer until these blatantly racist actions turn into an everyday norm to us, and our country is not known as a land of opportunity? How much longer until we are no longer known as the "Land of the Free and Home of the Brave", but instead a country feared by people with hopes and dreams?
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                We are at great risk of losing everything our country was built on: the diversity, the morals, the opportunities. It is our job as citizens to voice our concerns, as that is the greatest power we are bestowed in a democratic republic. It is what has guided the hand of reformation in times past, and is the key to protecting our peace in the present.
