                Across the country, teachers and child-care workers have reported a drastic increase in volatile behaviors among children. While most of this could be linked to the increase of bad parenting—families now spend less quality time together more than they ever have—an additional factor has catalyzed the growth of this behavior in younger children: technology. Gen Alpha is the first generation to be born into the peak age of technological advancement, younger members of Gen Z have also fallen victim to the addictive grip of technology.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Technology fosters a complex internal and mental battle within the malleable, developing brains of children. While introducing a child to their own iPad or laptop at a young age can encourage a sense of independence—especially if their use of the device is not monitored closely—it also comes with a large cost of implications that affect a child's behavior with their family and friends.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Yuta Giles is an after-school child-care provider who also teaches youth classes at Emler Swim Schools in Austin and works with children ranging 3 to 11 years of age. When asked if notices extreme polarity in his students' etiquette in his swim classes with him, as the authority, he said, "Sometimes. Most of my students are usually too young to understand what a 'class' is when they start with me, so they don't really know what's happening. There's a few of my students that tend to do dangerous things in the water to be funny, so it's more difficult to keep them safe while teaching them."
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                However, when asked about the after-school program he works at, Giles had different things to say. "A lot of the kids that are in the program don't usually get picked up until around 6:30—or even 7—at night. By the end of the night they're completely drained and in their most emotional states. We have a strict no-technology policy for them so they get really bored. They refuse to play board games and when they try to play with one another, it ends in chaos. Screaming and fighting. These kids can not communicate effectively when they're upset about something and thrash on the floor instead. These are older kids too, and they haven't learned to get along, let alone tell us when they're upset over something."
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Children gain stimulation from two main sources now: spontaneity and technology. Both give them the instant gratification their rapid attention spans require. When they are not receiving the fulfillment of the clicks and taps from the screens they use for hours everyday, the only other way to draw fulfillment from is by releasing it viscerally. Shown through Giles' accounts, children are exhibiting extreme rash behavior, their inability to control their emotions and actions, when separated from this stimulation.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The constantly shortening attention spans—which will inevitably affect a child's performance in school, and will require other methods of teaching, demanding teachers to jump through additional hoops to engage their students—is not the only cause for concern. The prolonged use of the screen hinders face-to-face contact, and when gone cold turkey by being put in situations where their social skills are necessary, their inability to communicate leads to immediate frustration and anger. They can't express their feelings or understand other children experiencing the same difficulty.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                So what now? Obviously this is an issue that reaches beyond a child's own mind as its claws branch outwards like a plague, affecting the younger generation by each person. The use of technology is still so new, the long-term effects are yet to be studied. There are no clear indications of what to do next. Like with all addictions, it's never a good idea to break off completely. Being no child psychologist myself, the best one can do when met with a technology-addicted child is setting limits on what they can do on the device at a time, closely monitoring what they watch.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Most sporadic and violent behavior stems from what children see online. Thoughtful and aware behavior is necessary to cultivate empathy and kindness in the younger generations, something we rarely see as entertainment gets more violent, and humans become more numb to the suffering around them. The life-long debilitating effects of prolonged technology use in children is yet to be uncovered; however, one thing we can be certain of is that this hyper-active comportment, and reduced attention span is only the beginning.
