                Do you ever find yourself lying awake at 9:00 PM on a school night?
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                You went to bed early so you could get a full 9 hours of sleep, but your body is just not agreeing with you. Well, if you're wanting to know why, you've stumbled across the right article, because here you'll learn not only what is causing this, but how to fix it too!
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Circadian Rhythm</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Our circadian rhythms are known as our bodies' internal clocks, a natural cycle that repeats roughly every 24 hours. It helps to synchronize your body's activities with the day to night cycle, and influences various bodily functions, including hormone production, digestion, body temperature, and...sleep-wake cycles.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Factors Influence It?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                These rhythms are primarily controlled by light exposure, (especially morning sunlight) which helps to regulate melatonin production (sleep hormone). However, there are other factors that can influence it, including: stress, physical activity, travel, food intake, mental health conditions, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Circadian Rhythm is also heavily affected by light value. Our bodies associate being awake with daylight, and sleeping with the darkness that naturally occurs at night. When we perceive light through our eyes, especially blue light, a nerve sends signals to a part of our brain that prevent melatonin (a sleep-promoting hormone) from being sent to the pineal gland, therefore making it more difficult to fall asleep. Now, this wouldn't be a problem if everyone simply followed the lightness and darkness provided by the sky in the day and night, but due to ever growing prevalence of artificial light and blue light devices, it is more and more common for this natural cycle to be disrupted. On the other hand, when your body interprets darkness, this part of our brains signals to the pineal gland to begin melatonin production in response. As melatonin levels rise in the evening, they signal to the body to become drowsy and prepare for sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Through puberty, teens often experience a shift in their circadian rhythms, making it more difficult to sleep early and wake up early. This is because melatonin is released later at night compared to children and adults. Despite this, teens still need 8-10 hours of sleep per night, but many struggle to get enough due to early school start times, which don't coincide with their naturally shifted sleep-wake cycles. Also, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), puberty simultaneously introduces energy dips, boosts, and slumps for most teenagers. See image above.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Happens if Our Circadian Rhythms Get Disrupted?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                It's not uncommon for peoples' rhythms to fall out of sync, in fact there are many factors in our bodies or environments that can affect them. Certain gene variants, neurological diseases, travelling, and blue light are all examples of this.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                There are many long and short term effects that could occur when our circadian rhythms fall out of sync. Short term, people can experience drowsiness, coordination issues, and struggles with focus and learning. In the long term, however, effects only worsen. Sleep loss and continually shifting circadian rhythms introduce higher possibilities of an array of conditions such as: obesity, diabetes, mood disorders, heart and blood pressure problems, and in some cases, cancer. Additionally, it can also worsen existing inherited health problems.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How Can I Fix My Circadian Rhythm?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The key to setting a good circadian rhythm is maintaining a sleep-wake cycle of around 8 hours and at stable times. There are many ways to fix this cycle, from changing habits to supplements. But these solutions, of course, will vary depending on the severity of the problem.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Chronotherapy is a commonly used tactic to help fix many people's circadian rhythms. The name could come off as a more complicated process, but in reality, this just means changing your bedtime gradually by going to bed 2 or 3 hours earlier or later until reaching a regular sleep-wake schedule.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                An important tool for improvement is lifestyle changes. Small changes can make a difference! Through maintaining regular sleep and wake times even on weekends, avoiding napping, and consuming less alcohol and less caffeine (especially at least 6-8 hours before bed), you may see large differences in your energy supply throughout the day.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Exercise is also proven to have many health benefits such as aiding in prevention of obesity and heart diseases, but also promoting sleep quality. Exercise can regulate your circadian rhythm and improve sleep by stimulating your body to produce and release melatonin.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                To increase melatonin levels, meditation is commonly used. It can do so by improving its production in the pineal gland, and also slowing our metabolisms, which actually allows the body to conserve energy and is helpful for the many restorative processes our bodies engage in during sleep.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                So, if your sleep schedule ever seems "messed up", you're not alone, and there's a biological reason behind it! From natural shifts in your circadian rhythm during adolescence, to modern-day habits like scrolling late at night, many factors can throw off your internal clock. But...good news is: your rhythm isn't broken, it just needs a little help to get it back on track. With small, consistent lifestyle changes and understanding of how your body works, you can reset your sleep cycle and start waking up feeling more rested, alert, and ready to take on the day.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                So...next time you're staring at the ceiling at 9 PM, remember, your body might just be asking for a little patience, a little sunlight, and a lot less screen time.
